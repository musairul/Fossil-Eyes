# Fossil-Eyes

## GreatUniHack24 Project - "Travel through time" Challenge

Due to changes in the environment such as climate change, rising sea levels and global warming, fossils are becoming much rarer and harder to find. This has massive impacts in terms of preserving our history, and reduces ability of paeleontologists to be able to gather insights about what life was like millions of years ago. 

Fossil-Eyes aims to stop this, by encouraging users to document any fossils they find. Fossils are like organic time capsules, and our product aims to help preserve the future by documenting the past.

Fossil-Eyes allows a user to take an image of a fossil. It then uses machine learning to detect the type of fossil and uses OpenAI API to generate facts and information about it. When a user finds a fossil, the location they found it in, the image, and a timestamp is added to a global map. This allows researchers to discover where types of fossils cluster, and document changes of fossil positions and types over time.

Fossil-Eyes also contains a collections feature, where any fossils found get added to the collection, encouraging users to find more to grow their collection.
